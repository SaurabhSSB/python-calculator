# Python-Command-Line Calculator 
A simple Python-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Floor Division (`//`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)
- Modulo (`%`)

## Features
- User-friendly input prompts
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero
- Ability to perform multiple calculations in one session

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaurabhSSB/python-calculator.git

Navigate to the directory:
bash
Copy code
cd command-line-calculator
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Follow the on-screen instructions.
Example Output

2. Add a License
Choose a license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) and include it in the repository. You can use GitHub's built-in license generator.
3. Improve Documentation
Add comments to your code to explain each section clearly for beginners or contributors.
4. Enhance User Experience
You could implement more features like:
Support for floating-point numbers.
Enhanced operator validation (in check instead of match).
Ability to handle multiple numbers in a single operation (e.g., 1 + 2 + 3).
A history of calculations in the current session.
5. Test Cases
Add a test file (e.g., test_calculator.py) with sample test cases to demonstrate the reliability of the program.
6. Use a .gitignore
Add a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files like __pycache__.
